# What is a flowchart?

A flowchart is a diagram that depicts a process, system or computer algorithm.

 They are widely used in multiple fields to document, study, plan, improve and communicate often complex processes in clear, easy-to-understand diagrams. 

Flowcharts, sometimes spelled as flow charts, use rectangles, ovals, diamonds and potentially numerous other shapes to define the type of step, along with connecting arrows to define flow and sequence. 

They can range from simple, hand-drawn charts to comprehensive computer-drawn diagrams depicting multiple steps and routes. If we consider all the various forms of flowcharts, they are one of the most common diagrams on the planet, used by both technical and non-technical people in numerous fields. 

Flowcharts are sometimes called by more specialized names such as Process Flowchart, Process Map, Functional Flowchart, Business Process Mapping, Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN),  or Process Flow Diagram (PFD). 

They are related to other popular diagrams, such as Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) Activity Diagrams.

## Flowcharts for computer programming/algorithms

As a visual representation of data flow, flowcharts are useful in writing a program or algorithm and explaining it to others or collaborating with them on it. You can use an algorithm flowchart to spell out the logic behind a program before ever starting to code the automated process. It can help to organize big-picture thinking and provide a guide when it comes time to code. More specifically, flowcharts can:

- Demonstrate the way code is organized.
- Visualize the execution of code within a program.
- Show the structure of a website or application.
- Understand how users navigate a website or program.

Often, programmers may write pseudocode, a combination of natural language and computer language able to be read by people. This may allow greater detail than the flowchart and serve either as a replacement for the flowchart or as a next step to actual code.

Related diagrams used in computer software include:

- Unified Modeling Language (UML): This is a general-purpose language used in software engineering for modeling.
- Nassi-Shneiderman Diagrams: Used for structured computer programming. Named after - Isaac Nassi and Ben Shneiderman, who developed it in 1972 at SUNY-Stony Brook. Also called Structograms.
- DRAKON charts: DRAKON is an algorithmic visual programming language used to produce flowcharts.

## How flowcharts are used in numerous other fields

Beyond computer programming, flowcharts have many uses in many diverse fields.

In any field:

- Document and analyze a process.
- Standardize a process for efficiency and quality.
- Communicate a process for training or understanding by other parts of the organization.
- Identify bottlenecks, redundancies and unnecessary steps in a process and improve it.
Education:

- Plan coursework and academic requirements.
Create a lesson plan or oral presentation.
- Organize a group or individual project.
- Show a legal or civil process, like voter registration.
- Plan and structure creative writing, like lyrics or poetry.
- Demonstrate character development for literature and film.
Represent the flow of algorithms or logic puzzles.
- Understand a scientific process, like the Krebs cycle.
- Chart an anatomical process, such as digestion.
- Map out symptoms and treatment for diseases/disorders.
- Communicate hypotheses and theories, like Maslowâ€™s hierarchy of needs.
Sales and marketing:

- Plot out the flow of a survey.
- Chart a sales process.
- Plan research strategies.
- Show registration flows.
- Disseminate communication policies, like an emergency PR plan.
